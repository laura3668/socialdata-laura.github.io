# Global Life Expectancy: What Social Factors Reveal About Our Lifespan
_By Cecilie Mai Do & Laura Pascual Hebrero_

When we think about life expectancy, we often focus on factors like healthcare access, diet, and genetics. But what if the secret to a longer life lies not in our physical bodies, but in the social forces around us? Recent studies suggest that the quality of our relationships, our mental health, and the social structures we navigate also play an important role in determining how long we live. The connections we maintain with family and friends, the support systems we have in place, and even the mental toll of societal pressures can shape our lifespans in ways we might not fully understand.

Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress can be just as detrimental to our life expectancy as physical illness, while a lack of social support or the prevalence of suicide rates in certain regions can be direct indicators of how social environments influence longevity. These hidden factors—often overlooked in traditional healthcare discussions—could be critical pieces of the puzzle when it comes to understanding life expectancy across different populations.

This article will explore weather social factors, from mental health challenges to the importance of social connections, impact life expectancy worldwide. By examining the data and digging deeper into the ways our society affects our lifespan, we can gain a clearer picture of what really keeps us alive—and why some of us don't make it as long as others.

### Life Expectancy at Birth Across the Globe 
To explore the intricate relationship between social factors and life expectancy, we turn to the World Health Organization's [Global Health Estimates (GHE): Life expectancy at birth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920307960). The GHE data has been enriched by combining it with additional indicators from [Human Development reports](https://hdr.undp.org) to create [Life Expectancy at Birth Across the Globe](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/life-expectancy-at-birth-across-the-globe/data) This comprehensive dataset offers insights into life expectancy at birth across 194 countries, including standardized ISO3 country codes and regional groupings by continent.

Looking at the years from **2000-2020**, the data reveals that the global average life expectancy at birth rose from about 66.7 to 71.8 years—an increase of over five years. This two-decade period reflects sustained improvements in healthcare access, disease control, and living standards across much of the world. However, these trends are not uniform across the globe. In 2020, Monaco once again topped the charts with an average life expectancy of *86.5 years*. In great contrast, Chad recorded the lowest figure at just *52.8 years*—a 34-year gap that highlights the deep and persistent inequalities in global health outcomes.

While the overall trend is encouraging, the uneven distribution of these growths reminds us that life expectancy is influenced by a variety of factors.

### Values and demography discussion

As seen on this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920307960), values are not only culture-wise but also vary with age, thus the age distribution for each country should be considered...
